# Azerbaijani-Text-Preprocessing
Data cleaning, sentiment labeling, domain awareness, corpus merging, word embedding, some analysis to gain insight.

## ABSTRACT
The purpose of this work is to understand the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this project, we gained experience in data preprocessing, sentiment annotation, and word embedding. We used two different embedding models and analyzed their outputs on Azerbaijani language datas.
